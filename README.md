# Automating-Egovernment-Feedback-Services-with-Machine-Learning-And-Artificial-Intelligence
Recently, AI has boosted the existing state of the art in a growing number of sectors. Some challenges exist that hinder its widespread implementation in e-government applications, both for the advancement of e-government systems and for people' interaction with government. E-government systems face various hurdles, and in this study, we present a framework that employs AI technology to automate and facilitate e-government services. For begin, we'll draw out a strategy for managing e-government data assets and information. This is followed by construction of a set of deep learning models targeted at automating numerous government services. On top of that, we've presented an electronic government platform architecture that makes it easy to build and implement AI functionalities. With the aim of reducing processing times, cutting costs, and enhancing citizen happiness, we're aiming to upgrade the current status of e-government services by adopting proven AI approaches
